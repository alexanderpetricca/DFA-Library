# DFA Library Project

Library project from William S Vincent's book, Django for APIs v4.0. I've updated with more up to date versions of the key packages; Django, Django Rest Framework and Whitenoise.

Project contains basic Book model and a basic traditional Django view / template that displays all books. It also includes an API app that includes a basic API that lists all books.
